# DXCLondonCodingClub
DXC London Coding club code, problems and notes.

We are going to start a Walbrook coding club for anyone and everyone to come and enjoy coding. 

The sessions will have a mix of different levels of Coders, weather you are a complete novice like me and have never coded before or are a pro that wants to explore a new language and help beginners by passing on your knowledge! 

In the first session we will get to know everyone in the room and set some projects for different ability groups. 

We will run the sessions on a Tuesday evening 5-6pm. 

Please message me if you would like to be added onto the calendar invite. 

In the Summer we will be looking to invite some local school in for a day of codes so this is a great target to learn your code by. 

Happy Coding!

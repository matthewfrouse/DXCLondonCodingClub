Below are three problems that also have *bonus problems* which is little bit more challanging than the orignal one.

Attempt to solve the problem before moving onto *bonus problem*.

You can use any language you like. Answers will be disclosed during the meeting and posted here later.

### Problem 1
Fibnocci series is a series of numbers in which next number is formed by adding the last two numbers. First two numbers of the series are 1.
For e.g. 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13 and so on. Below is how its calculated.

| |1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
||||1+1=|1+2=|2+3=|3+5=|8+5=|8+13=|
|Series|1|1|2|3|5|8|13|21|



As we can see above 5th number in this serise is 5.

Can you find the 100th number in this series?

*(Bonus problem: what is the first number in fibnocci seriese which is 5 number long. nnnnn)*


### Problem 2
By definition, Palindrome is

*"a word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same backwards as forwards, e.g. madam."*

Can you write a program to check if a string is a palindrome?

*(Bonus problem: number palindromes are also possible. For example 121 is a palindrome. Can you find out how many palindrome numbers are there in between 10 and 99999.)*


### Problem 3
How many pairs of two positive numbers are there such that:

**Number 1 + Number 2 = 100**

*(Bonus problem: how many pair of positive numbers (x,y) exist such that: **x<sup>2</sup> + y<sup>2</sup> = 1000**)*
